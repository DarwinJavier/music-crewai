music_research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic}.
    Cover both historical context and what is happening right now: key bands, songs, albums, scenes,
    movements, and turning points that shaped {topic}.
    Then recommend current artists/releases/scenes connected to {topic} and explain why they fit.
    Finally, give a 3 to 5 year outlook: what directions {topic} is likely to evolve toward, what signals
    support that view, and what could disrupt it.
  expected_output: >
    A structured brief with:
    1) 10 to 15 bullet points of the most relevant historical context about {topic}
    2) 10 to 15 bullet points on current trends, key releases, and active scenes around {topic}
    3) 8 to 12 current recommendations (artists + 1 to 2 starter tracks each) tied to {topic}
    4) A 5 to 8 bullet outlook for {topic} over the next few years with clear reasoning

indie_label_specialist_task:
  description: >
    Identify indie labels (global) that cover or have historically covered {topic} and explain how they
    define the scene. For each label, highlight signature aesthetics, notable releases, and “sister” bands
    in the roster that help map the ecosystem around {topic}.
    Include discovery infrastructure: venues/festivals where these artists commonly play, how the labels
    market (channels, communities, formats), and credible fanzines / scene blogs / social accounts that
    consistently surface relevant music tied to {topic}.
  expected_output: >
    A scene map for {topic} including:
    1) 8 to 12 indie labels (each with: location, sound/identity, 3 to 5 key artists, 3 key releases)
    2) 10 to 20 additional artists to explore via those labels (with quick “why they matter” notes)
    3) A list of venues/festivals/recurring nights commonly associated with the {topic} ecosystem
    4) A list of fanzines/blogs/social accounts that reliably cover {topic}

dsp_playlist_editor_task:
  description: >
    Dissect how {topic} relates to adjacent songs, bands, scenes, and micro-genres, then build an ecosystem
    of moods and feelings around it. Use a RateYourMusic-style approach: descriptors, influences, and other
    metadata cues to create intelligent playlists that go beyond simple genre labels.
    Create multiple mood-based playlists that act as “on-ramps” and “deep cuts” paths for {topic}, with
    sequencing rationale (how each playlist flows and why the order works).
  expected_output: >
    A playlist programming pack for {topic} including:
    1) A “descriptor map” (12 to 20 RYM-like descriptors + what they mean for {topic})
    2) An adjacency map (nearby scenes/micro-genres + 2 to 3 bridge artists each)
    3) 4 to 6 playlists (12 to 20 tracks each), each with a clear mood/theme title and 3 to 5 sentence sequencing rationale

radio_programmer_dj_task:
  description: >
    Explore the type of audience that {topic} appeals to and design a listening experience around it.
    Define listener personas, their motivations, and what “hooks” them (familiarity, novelty, nostalgia,
    intensity, vibe, lyrics, community identity).
    Then propose a podcast-style or radio-style program concept built around {topic}: format, segments,
    pacing, and a pilot episode plan that would resonate with the identified audience.
  expected_output: >
    A radio/podcast concept doc for {topic} including:
    1) 2 to 4 audience personas (who they are, what they want, where they hang out, what they already like)
    2) A show concept (title, premise, tone, segment structure, runtime, cadence)
    3) A pilot episode outline (segment-by-segment) plus a suggested “set” (10 to 15 tracks) with short DJ notes
    4) The value proposition of the show (what makes it unique and why it matters)
    5) The distribution strategy for the show (how it will be promoted and how it will be distributed, including social media, streaming platforms, and other channels)

critic_podcaster_task:
  description: >
    Write a short, vivid essay about {topic} that creates meaning and narrative—not just facts.
    Use the research and scene/playlist/radio insights as inputs: historical context, labels, audience
    dynamics, moods, and adjacent ecosystems around {topic}.
    The essay should be specific, opinionated, and readable, with memorable framing and concrete entry points.
  expected_output: >
    A polished essay about {topic} (300 to 500 words) that includes:
    1) A strong opening hook + thesis on what {topic} “is really about”
    2) Historical lineage + key moments (without turning into a textbook)
    3) A “start here” section (5 essential tracks/albums with 1 to 2 sentences each)
    4) A “go deeper” section (5 deeper cuts + why they reward attention)
    5) A closing that connects {topic} to culture and what it signals next
